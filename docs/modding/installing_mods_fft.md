# FINAL FANTASY TACTICS Mod Manager

The Reloaded II mod manager combined with the FINAL FANTASY TACTICS Mod Loader is the primary way to manage mods for FFT. 

If you are familiar with FFXVI Modding, the process is roughly the same, otherwise, you can get started here.

## Requirements

* :material-github: [Reloaded-II Mod Manager](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/releases)
* :simple-nexusmods: [fftivc.utility.modloader (Mod Loader)](https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/4) - :material-github: [Github Mirror](https://github.com/Nenkai/fftivc.utility.modloader/releases/)

## Text Tutorial

### Setting up Reloaded-II

1. Download Reloaded-II's `Release.zip`, or `Setup.exe`.
2. Extract `Release.zip` to its own folder or run the `Setup.exe` and install it.
3. Open `Reloaded-II.exe`.
4. Press the `+` Icon to add a game and select `FFT_enhanced.exe` from the game's folder (you can navigate to it by right clicking the game on Steam and heading to Manage -> Browse Local Files). 

    !!! warning
        **You should also register the classic version otherwise switching between modes may not work. The executable name is `FFT_classic.exe`**.

5. Drag & Drop `fftivc.utility.modloader.7z` to Reloaded-II. You may need to restart Reloaded-II to be able to drag-drop (as Windows disallows drag-drop on elevated processes).
6. In Reloaded-II make sure to tick on the checkbox next to `FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles Mod Loader` to enable it.
7. Launch the game through Reloaded-II using 'Launch Application'.

2. Same process, drag & drop.
3. Press `Launch Application` to launch the game and install the mods.

## Removing Mods

To remove mods, you can either:

* Disable all mods in Reloaded-II **except** the Mod Loader.
* Delete any `modded` .pac files in the game's `data/` folders.
